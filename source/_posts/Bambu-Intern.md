I'm excited to announce that I will be a Graphics Algorithms Engineer Intern at [Bambu Lab](https://www.bambulab.com/) for the summer of 2024! I'm excited to work on developing and implementing graphics algorithms for slicer software, optimizing processing quality and performance, and conducting research and writing proposals for new functionality enhancements. I'm looking forward to a great summer!
