I'm excited to announce that I will be a teaching assistant for the undergrad and grad level course [CS 480/680 Intro to Computer Graphics](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/courses/cas-cs-480/) course at Boston University for fall 2024! I'm excited to help students learn about the fundamentals of computer graphics and to support them.

I will be holding weekly office hours, answering posts on Piazza, grading assignments and teaching some discussion session. I'm looking forward to a wonderful semester!
