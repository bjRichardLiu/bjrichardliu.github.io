I'm happy to announce that I will be a course assistant for the course [CS 237 Probability in Computing](https://www.bu.edu/academics/cas/courses/cas-cs-237/) at Boston University for [Fall 2023](https://cs-people.bu.edu/januario/teaching/cs237/fa23/index.html) and [Spring 2024](https://cs-people.bu.edu/januario/teaching/cs237/sp24/index.html)! I'm excited to help students learn about the fundamentals of probability and data science, as well as Python and Jupyter notebooks.

I will be holding weekly office hours, answering posts on Piazza, grading assignments and help with discussion sessions. I'm looking forward to a great semester!
