## Titanium Laser Printing | Python, Laser Cutter
#### February 2024 to May 2024
Project Link: [Titanium Laser Printing](https://bjrichardliu.github.io/Titanium_Laser_Printing/)
Lead a class research group to explore color printing on titanium using a laser cutter. I wrote all the code that controls the laser cutter, which would be used to control the anodization process on the titanium surface.
